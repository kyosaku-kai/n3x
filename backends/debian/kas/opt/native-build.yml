# Disable ISAR cross-compilation for native architecture builds.
#
# Use when the host architecture matches the target architecture
# (e.g., building arm64 targets on arm64 hardware).
#
# ISAR defaults to ISAR_CROSS_COMPILE="1" (crossvars.bbclass ??= weak
# assignment). This overlay provides a strong override to disable
# cross-compilation and use the native toolchain directly.
#
# In CI: appended automatically when runner arch == target arch.
# Locally: append to kas-build command when building on native hardware:
#   kas-build kas/base.yml:...:kas/opt/native-build.yml
